# Amazon-Product-Reviews

•	The core challenge of the project is to use the unstructured information from Amazon product reviews, which can be positive, negative, or neutral, to make data-driven decisions that improve marketing strategies and product development. 

•	The proposed solution involves developing Python-based methods to handle and analyze large amounts of this data. 

•	The process includes cleaning the dataset, converting text into numerical features, and using cross-validation to analyze the data with various methods such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), ADA Boost, and Neural Networks.

•	The project uses an Amazon review dataset from Kaggle, which contains 568,454 instances and 10 attributes in a CSV file.
