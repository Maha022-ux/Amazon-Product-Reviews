I bought this bag of chips the other day and they have a very different taste  It tastes cheaper I dont know how else to put it I also noticed that the chips seemed to be less cooked as I did not see any of the browner colored chips that have the most flavor I am hoping that nothing has changed with the ingredients or process used to produce this product Did I just get a weird batch?

4,4,1316995200,'The Price is Right','I use a lot of raw cocoa for my power protein drinks  With the high price of cocoa on the commodity market this is an excellent price especially for an organic product  The cocoa is less tasty than my regular brand but does very well for the price  My main complaint is that the product came in a sealed plastic bag with NO label  I would like to see an organic label as well as the nutrition info for the product',4
3,3,1323820800,'NOT what I originally ordered BOO amazon','As another reviewer stated many of the reviews for this product are actually for a DIFFERENT raw cacao powder from alive and aware ecuadorian criollo raw cacao powder That is what I ordered about 3 months ago and it was AWESOME I am almost out and when I went to reorder my amazon account directed me to this product from SAQUIN?? which is NOT what I ordered and it is more expensive the same base price but i got it with FREE shipping not 15 bucks so that is a big price increase  I know it was still from alive and aware midfebruary but recently something changed<br I am really confused/irritated how my review for alive and aware raw cacao got switched to a different brand from a different seller?? i mean cant they just say out of stock or currently unavailable like they do with other stuff why would they switch reviews around?<br Seems very underhanded to transfer reviews from a different product to a newer one especially since as the other reviewer stated they are NOT comparable and this stuff from SAQUIN is terrible compared to what we were getting from alive and aware also the price increase is pretty shocking i guess it is the market and raw cacao is in higher demand Too bad that was such an awesome price for really awesome cacao<br I did recently order alive and awares raw criollo cacao nibs and i highly recommend those they are as the description states from alive and aware not another brand<br Frankly I am beginning to wonder about some of the brands and vendors that ship from Amazon I know they have warehouses in different parts of the country but it is a little suspicious and I just wish there was more transparency about what comes from Amazon and what comes from a different company seems like halal everyday alive and aware etc are almost interchangable since amazon took the liberty to take reviews from alive and aware and post them to halaleveryday/saquin are these really different companies under the auspices of amazon or is it amazon by a different name only? like the other reviewer said he ordered something that said alive and aware in the description and when it came it was from saquin/halal everyday  who knows i just want some more transparency so i can have more trust when ordering from amazon  For now i am going to seek out another source not through amazon that stands behind their cacao it is very important to me for health benefits and the ecological/social impacts of where it is harvested to know that i am getting topnotch certified organic raw cacao if amazon is going to be so wishywashy and sneaky Im going elsewhere wagging finger at amazon  I think for now I will leave the following review for alive and aware in case they do bring it back  Heavens to Besty this stuff ROCKS It is such agoodvalue too maybe the best out there as I have def shopped around  I have tried a few different brands of raw organic cacao powder and this is certainly topnotch  Kudos to Alive and Aware for offering it at such a reasonable price<br I am not a raw foodie per say but I try to follow a neopaleo protocol which includes super foods such as raw cacao  Properly prepared with just enough natural sweetener I think this is a truly guiltfree pleasure  It is LOADED with antioxidants as you probably know  So go ahead get the big bag  You can then share it with friends and family and turn them on to this super groovy super food of the Gods theobroma as they say <br My favorite way to consume it is actually as not so hot cocoa I just whisk it into gently heated fresh raw whole milk or cream so its not too hot and to preserve as much nutrients as possible I know its not 100  raw  but hey this is how I love it add just enough sweetener I like sorghum molasses a scant tspoon a bit of maca powder a dash of real salt and after thats thoroughly whisked I top it off with a spoonful of EVO COCONUT OIL YUMM I have converted everyone even the kids I babysit who used to prefer swiss miss Or I make a concentrated warm cocoa beverage sans maca and coconut oil and then stir it into my raw milk for a half gallon of raw chocolate milk lightly sweetened  You better believe it goes fast  I love my family to get theirgoodold fashioned grass fed animal fats with bioavailable vitamins A D and the X factor read Weston A Price and loads of antioxidants from the cacao to boot  Plus cacao activates the seratonin receptors and sorry I am bit fuzzy but you know it makes you feelgoodand happy<br Also process it with EVO Coconut Oil and sweetener such as sorghum or honey or maple syrup in your cuisinart for heavenly truffles refrigerate for proper texture due to coconut oil  I often toss in soakeddried nuts and dried unsulfured fruit and shredded coconut for healthy truffle energy bars just process in batches so its kind of homogenous Like those lara bars but cheaper and no packaging and even organic or raw<br Go for it Buy this huge bag share thegoodess and youll be healthier and happier for it I guarantee  PEACE be with You',1

0,0,1348704000,'Equidorian OJio Arriba Carillo RAW Oranic Cacao','Raw Cacao Powder differs greatly in taste than processed Cacao Powder Commercial cacao powder is often triple fermented and then roasted Commercial companies are more interested in a product which has no nutritional value but great consistency in flavor Commercial Cacao Powder is mono tonal in flavor Raw Cacao is everything that Commercial Cacao isnt It is a antioxidant superfood which has no equal The taste does vary slightly from one part of the year to the next As to taste it has a wonderful intoxicating tannin like aroma with mild overtones of Mahogany In foods it has a complexity which some cooks will absolutely love while the others who read from the book may want to go back to there standard one dimensional cacao In baking I believe it goes well with other flavors such as Almond Extract If you want to do an extraordinary butter cream icing with a tad of Almond extract your icing will have no equal In chocolate cake I personally would go heavy and do a buttermilk or sour cream cake The acid helps to unify and amplify flavors I like making cake with 60  cake flour which is about has about 5  wheat gluten and 40  rice flour The reason for this should be obvious The heavy texture that rice flour imparts makes your cake stand proud and one bite is then never more than enough  Raw Cocoa powder is rich in polyphenols such as catechins and procyanidins and has been shown to inhibit lowdensity lipoprotein LDL oxidation and atherogenesis in a variety of models Human studies have also shown daily intake of cocoa increases plasma highdensity lipoprotein HDL and decreases LDL levels although the drug companies having endeavored to understand the mechanism in which this happens',5
